# Hand-Gesture-Detection

The project uses getting data script to collect data using OpenCV and cvzone.handtracking module into three classes.

The model is made using transfer learning, using mobilenetV2 as the convolution base and adding classifer layers on top. 

In the end, the testing script is used to display the prediction along with real time hand gesture detection.
